üìä Bank Marketing SQL Project

üìå Overview

This project explores a bank marketing dataset using SQL. The goal is to analyze customer demographics, financial behaviors, and campaign outcomes to support better marketing strategies, improve loan targeting, and optimize customer segmentation.

üéØ Objectives

- Analyze customer demographics (age, marital status, education, job type).
- Identify financial patterns (balances, loans, defaults).
- Segment customers by age, balance, and education.
- Evaluate marketing campaign effectiveness.
- Provide business insights and solutions for banks.

üí° Business Problems & Solutions
1Ô∏è‚É£ How many customers are married and have a tertiary education?
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS married_tertiary_count
FROM bank 
WHERE marital = 'married' AND education = 'tertiary';
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average age of customers for each job category?
```sql
SELECT
    job,
    ROUND(AVG(age), 0) AS avg_age 
FROM bank 
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY avg_age DESC;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total & average balance for customers with/without housing loans
```sql
SELECT
    loan,
    SUM(balance) AS total_balance,
    AVG(balance) AS avg_balance
FROM bank
GROUP BY loan;
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Rank customers by balance within each marital group
```sql
SELECT 
    age,
    job,
    marital,
    balance,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY marital ORDER BY balance DESC) as balance_rank
FROM bank
ORDER BY marital, balance DESC;
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Managers/Entrepreneurs with no default & balance > 1000
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM bank
WHERE job IN ('management', 'entrepreneur')
    AND `default` = 'no'
    AND balance > 1000;
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ Customers with balance above average of their education group
```sql
WITH education_balance AS (
    SELECT 
        age,
        job,
        marital,
        education,
        balance,
        AVG(balance) OVER (PARTITION BY education) AS avg_education_balance
    FROM bank
)
SELECT *
FROM education_balance 
WHERE balance > avg_education_balance
ORDER BY education, balance DESC;
```

7Ô∏è‚É£ Age categories by job type
```sql
SELECT 
    job,
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 30 AND 59 THEN 'Middle'
        ELSE 'Senior'
    END AS age_category,
    COUNT(*) AS customers_count,
    AVG(balance) AS avg_balance
FROM bank
GROUP BY 
    job,
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 30 AND 59 THEN 'Middle'
        ELSE 'Senior'
    END 
ORDER BY job, age_category;
```

8Ô∏è‚É£ Average campaign duration by previous outcome
```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(poutcome, 'No Data') AS outcome,
    ROUND(AVG(duration), 2) AS avg_duration_seconds,
    ROUND(AVG(duration) / 60, 2) AS avg_duration_minutes,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
    MIN(duration) AS shortest_call,
    MAX(duration) AS longest_call
FROM bank
GROUP BY poutcome
ORDER BY avg_duration_seconds DESC;
```

9Ô∏è‚É£ Customers with both housing & personal loans
```sql
SELECT 
    job,
    SUM(CASE WHEN housing = 'yes' AND loan = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS both_loans_count,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN housing = 'yes' AND loan = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
    ) AS pct_with_both_loans
FROM bank 
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY pct_with_both_loans DESC;
```

üîü Job-level stats: total, avg age, median, defaults
```sql
WITH job_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        job,
        age,
        balance,
        `default`,
        PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY job ORDER BY balance) AS percentile
    FROM bank
)
SELECT 
    job,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count,
    ROUND(AVG(age), 1) AS avg_age,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN percentile BETWEEN 0.4 AND 0.6 THEN balance END), 2) AS median_balance,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN `default` = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS pct_with_default
FROM job_stats
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY total_count DESC;
```

üîç Key Findings

- Married + tertiary education customers form a valuable premium segment.
- Managers/entrepreneurs tend to have higher balances and lower default risks.
- Customers with housing + personal loans show higher financial dependency.
- Middle-aged group (30‚Äì59) is the largest customer base.
- Campaign call duration does not always correlate with positive outcomes.

üìà Conclusion

- This SQL project provides insights into customer behavior, financial risk, and marketing campaign outcomes.
By applying these findings, banks can:
- Improve targeting of marketing campaigns.
- Identify high-value and high-risk customers.
- Personalize loan and savings products.
- Optimize campaign strategies for better conversion rates.
